        form. You can also add other necessary details. When your request
        is received, you will be contacted for further detailing and

        best to change the address before the delivery process begins.

        verify your order and the delivery details.

        There is room for returning your order, but provided that the product 
        has issues. Because of the sensivity of clothing and other fashion
        items, returning an order will be possible only when there is 
        an issue with the product.
